# My-uMail-and-examples
A modified umail https://github.com/shawwwn/uMail with lots of debugging incorporated.

Some example mail_functions:
- sending an alarm,
- sending a .csv file and
- sending an image, thanks to pm4r [https://github.com/shawwwn/uMail/issues/2
](https://github.com/shawwwn/uMail/issues/2)

There is a config.py with the lines:

#  enable/disable debugging
debug = False
